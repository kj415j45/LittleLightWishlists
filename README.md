# Little Light Wishlists project

This project is powered by [Little Light Wishlists](https://wishlists.littlelight.club/), aiming to help people escape the perk pool abyss.  
Hope you won't need this wishlist after playing enough time.  
**Remember: No trash weapon, only wrong player.** ~~But *Leviathan's Breath* is real trash~~

## What perk will be recommend

When the perk make sense in certain battle, like roaming worlds or fighting in the dungeon.  
Or the perk can only be rolled on this weapon ?_?  

## And what will be picked as God Roll

Only when the perk can be used in most battle. It may not be the best choice, but you can give it a try.
